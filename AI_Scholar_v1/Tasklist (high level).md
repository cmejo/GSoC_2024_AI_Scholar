# AI Scholar: High-Level Task List

Here's a high-level task list for your AI Scholar project, summarizing the key steps involved:

**I. Project Setup**

1. **Environment Preparation:**
   - Install Ubuntu Server, NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, cuDNN (if needed).
   - Set up Python and R environments with all required libraries.
2. **Project Initialization:**
   - Create a Git repository, set up version control, and (optionally) configure a CI/CD pipeline. 

**II. Data Acquisition and Processing**

1. **Acquire Research Papers:**
   - Download physics research papers from ArXiv, the Journal of Statistical Software, and the R Journal using APIs or web scraping techniques. 
2. **Extract and Clean Text:**
   - Use GROBID to extract text and citations from PDFs.
   - Clean and normalize the text, handling LaTeX and other specific formatting.
   - Deduplicate the dataset to remove duplicate papers.

**III. Knowledge Representation**

1. **Generate Embeddings:**
   - Train or load Word2Vec, FastText, or Sentence Transformer models to create word and phrase embeddings. 
   - Benchmark different embedding models to choose the best ones for your use case.
2. **Create Vector Database:**
   - Build a ChromaDB database using the generated embeddings.
   - Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) if necessary to optimize performance.
3. **Implement Semantic Search:**
   - Configure semantic search using Sentence Transformers or other relevant techniques.

**IV. Chatbot Core Functionality**

1. **Develop RAG Model:**
   - Choose a suitable LLM (Llama 3 or an alternative) and set it up with Ollama (or Hugging Face Transformers).
   - Fine-tune the LLM on relevant data (if needed).
   - Implement retrieval augmentation using LangChain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain`.
   - Design effective prompts to guide the LLM's responses. 
   - Experiment with and evaluate different RAG architectures.
2. **Build Recommendation System:**
   - Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or GNN-based recommendation algorithms.
   - Integrate user feedback to improve recommendations.
   - Address the cold-start problem for new users.
   - Evaluate the recommendation system's performance.

**V. Additional Features (Optional)**

1. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create an R API using `plumber` to generate visualizations.
   - Connect the Python chatbot to the R API and display visualizations in the interface.
   - Explore interactive visualizations using JavaScript libraries.
2. **GUI Development:**
   - Design and develop a user-friendly web interface using React and Material-UI (or similar).
   - Connect the GUI to the chatbot's backend API.
   - Consider adding user authentication for personalization. 

**VI. Evaluation and Deployment**

1. **Evaluate Chatbot Performance:**
   - Define metrics and create test sets to evaluate the performance of the RAG model, search functionality, and recommendation system.
2. **Deploy Chatbot:**
   - Choose a deployment method (simple script, web API, Docker container).
   - Consider deploying to a cloud platform for scalability and reliability.
   - Set up a reverse proxy (if using a web API) and monitoring tools.

**VII. Documentation and Communication**

1. **Document the Project:**
   - Maintain a clear and comprehensive `README.md` file.
   - Document your code and design decisions.
2. **Gather User Feedback:**
   - Collect feedback from users throughout the development process to guide improvements and ensure the chatbot meets their needs.

This high-level task list provides a concise overview of the steps involved in creating your AI Scholar chatbot. Remember to break down each high-level task into more detailed subtasks as you move through the project.
