# Repo Overview

Welcome to the Word2Vec Knowledge Graph repository! This notebook will walk you through the key components of the repository, explaining how each part contributes to the overall project.

## 1. Data Ingestion
We start by ingesting data from PDF files located in the `data/pdfs/` directory. The `data_ingestion.py` script extracts text from these PDFs.

```python
from src.data_ingestion import pdf_to_text

pdf_folder = '../home/cmejo/arxiv-dataset/pdf'
texts = pdf_to_text(pdf_folder)
print(texts[:1])  # Display the text from the first PDF
